Ver 1.3.2 Build 35
- Orders will now follow alt methods, Handlings will either check the cart or event_date input, if no input the use_alt lines will be ignored so payments arent asked if they are alt payments are not as we dont need to ask the system, it knows the handling id.

- created update.php, doesnt require smarty for the class.
- created tickets function, will grab the min date from a list of tickets, so when ordering stuff the min date is allways picked out,
