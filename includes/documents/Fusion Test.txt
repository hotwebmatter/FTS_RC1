Event Management > Venues > Modify Venue	[Seat Charts] Cannot undefine a seat on chart		General note
																					So if a seat is accidentally defined it can
																					never be blank/undefined again

Event Management > Venues > Modify Venue	[Seat Charts] Would be good if clicking the			General note
																					Zone / View icon it toggled the zone seats
																					on/off themselves rather than toggling between

																					could do with a little make-over. Maybe if each

																					Also suggest the filter being used on other lists
																					could be used here too to pick out tickets not yet
																					paid/sent/etc
